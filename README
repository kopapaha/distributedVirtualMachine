Virtual Machine implementation

wsn middleware features:
1. supports up to three concurrent applications
2. abstraction of individual memory space and execution for each apllication
3. round-robin application scheduling 
4. instruction set (support of basic instructions): ADD SUB INC DEC SET RET BGZ BEZ BRA LED RDB TMR
5. caching sensor reads (reduce energy consumption)

future extentions:
1. code migration over the distributed nodes
2. support for application-level result proccessing (msg handler execution)
3. transparent aggregation and dissemination of results to source node
